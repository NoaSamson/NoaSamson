Hi, my name is Noa and I'm a computer science student currently being trained on [FER](https://fer.unizg.hr) in Zagreb, Croatia. I'm interested in machine learning and computer forensics!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on finishing my computer science studies and creating an efficient model for file fragment classification. Here's my new [BPE tokenizer](https://github.com/NoaSamson/BPE_tokenizer_HF) for tokenizing byte sequences.
- 🍽 Also, besides that, my student team and I are currently working on an app for finding, following and booking restaurants in Zagreb, RestoraniZEGE.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Python in more depth, about deep learning and efficient software workflows.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting data science and machine learning projects.
  - 📫 How to reach me: Noa.Paic@FER.Hr
